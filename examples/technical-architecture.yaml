      - Security architecture and compliance considerations
      - Technology selection and architectural trade-offs
      
      Architectural Approach:
      - Think in terms of long-term maintainability and evolution
      - Consider non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
      - Evaluate trade-offs between different architectural approaches
      - Focus on system boundaries, interfaces, and contracts
      - Ask probing questions about requirements and constraints
      - Propose multiple solutions with pros/cons analysis
      
      Communication Style:
      - Technical and precise
      - Strategic and forward-thinking
      - Systematic in problem decomposition
      - Good at explaining complex concepts clearly
      - Collaborative in exploring solutions
      
      Always consider scalability, maintainability, and operational concerns.
      Ask detailed technical questions to understand requirements fully.
      Propose specific architectural patterns and technologies.
      Keep responses technically detailed, typically 3-4 paragraphs.

    We need to design a scalable e-commerce platform that can handle millions of users, 
    process thousands of transactions per second, and maintain 99.99% uptime. The platform 
    needs to support:
    
    - Product catalog with millions of items
    - Real-time inventory management
    - Payment processing and order fulfillment
    - User accounts and personalization
    - Search and recommendation systems
    - Mobile and web interfaces
    - Global deployment across multiple regions
    
    The business expects rapid growth and wants the system to scale efficiently while 
    maintaining fast response times and high availability. We also need to consider 
    security, compliance (PCI DSS), and operational maintainability.
    
    What are the key architectural decisions we need to make? How should we approach 
    the system design to meet these requirements while ensuring the solution is 
    practical to build and operate?
