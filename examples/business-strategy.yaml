    Our technology company has been growing steadily at 25% year-over-year for the past 
    three years. We're at a critical juncture where we need to decide our next strategic 
    moves for the next 2-3 years. We're considering several options:

    1. Geographic expansion into European and Asian markets
    2. Vertical integration by acquiring key suppliers or distributors
    3. Horizontal expansion into adjacent technology markets
    4. Significant investment in R&D for next-generation products
    5. Strategic partnerships with larger technology companies

    We have strong cash flow, a talented team of 150 employees, and solid market 
    position in our current segments. However, we're seeing increased competition 
    and some market saturation in our core business.

    Given this context, what strategic framework should we use to evaluate these 
    options? What key factors should we prioritize in our decision-making process?
