  initial_prompt: |
    Let's collaborate on creating an original story concept that explores the intersection 
    of technology and human emotion. I'm envisioning something that could work as either 
    a short story, novella, or even the foundation for a larger work.
    
    The story should be thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, dealing with themes 
    that feel both futuristic and deeply human. I'm interested in exploring how technology 
    might change the way we experience and express emotions, relationships, or identity.
    
    What creative directions spark your imagination? What kind of world, characters, or 
    central conflict could we develop that would make readers think differently about 
    technology's role in our emotional lives?
