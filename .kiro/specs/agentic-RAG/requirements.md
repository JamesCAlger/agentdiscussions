# RAG-Powered Q&A Agent – Requirements

> **Revision 1.0 – July 18 2025**
>
> This document captures the requirements for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to query unstructured documents through a conversational interface with full source attribution.

---

## 1 Purpose

Design a RAG-powered Q&A agent that allows users to upload unstructured documents, ask natural language questions, and receive accurate answers with detailed source attribution showing exactly which document and paragraph each factual statement comes from.

## 2 Scope

- **In scope**
  - Document ingestion and processing pipeline
  - Vector-based document retrieval system
  - Integration with existing agentic conversation framework
  - Source attribution with document and paragraph-level provenance
  - Support for common document formats (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .md)
  - Semantic document clustering and relationship mapping
  - Multi-modal support (images, charts, tables)

- **Out of scope** (this phase)
  - Template inference and document generation
  - Structured data sources (SQL databases)
  - Multi-user authentication and authorization
  - Advanced document management features
  - Real-time collaboration
  - Asynchronous processing workflows
  - Advanced security features

## 3 Primary Personas & Workflows

| Persona | Core Workflow |
|---------|---------------|
| **Knowledge Worker** | Upload documents → Ask questions → Review answers with source citations → Explore source documents |

## 4 Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Document Management

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to upload and manage my document collection, so that I can query information from my specific set of documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD file formats
2. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL extract text content while preserving paragraph boundaries
3. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL store document metadata including filename, upload date, and file size
4. WHEN a user views their document collection THEN the system SHALL display a list of uploaded documents with basic metadata
5. WHEN a user deletes a document THEN the system SHALL remove it from both storage and the search index

### 4.2 Document Processing & Indexing

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want my documents to be automatically processed and indexed, so that I can search through their content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content using document intelligence services
2. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL split content into logical paragraphs or chunks
3. WHEN content is chunked THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings for each chunk
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in a vector database with metadata
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user of the failure

### 4.3 Question & Answer Interface

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to ask natural language questions about my documents, so that I can quickly find relevant information without manually searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL accept natural language queries
2. WHEN a question is received THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant document chunks using vector similarity
3. WHEN relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive answer using an LLM
4. WHEN an answer is generated THEN the system SHALL return the response within 30 seconds
5. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the answer cannot be found in the available documents

### 4.4 Source Attribution & Provenance

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to see exactly which documents and paragraphs support each factual statement in the answer, so that I can verify the information and explore the source material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an answer contains factual statements THEN the system SHALL provide source citations for each statement
2. WHEN a citation is provided THEN it SHALL include the source document name and specific paragraph or section
3. WHEN a user clicks on a citation THEN the system SHALL display the relevant paragraph in context
4. WHEN multiple sources support a statement THEN the system SHALL show all relevant sources
5. WHEN a statement cannot be attributed to sources THEN the system SHALL clearly mark it as generated content

### 4.5 Conversation Management

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to have follow-up conversations about my documents, so that I can explore topics in depth through natural dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
2. WHEN conversation context is maintained THEN the system SHALL reference previous questions and answers appropriately
3. WHEN a user starts a new topic THEN the system SHALL allow clearing conversation history
4. WHEN a conversation becomes too long THEN the system SHALL manage context window limitations gracefully
5. WHEN a user references "the document mentioned earlier" THEN the system SHALL understand the reference from conversation history

## 10 Open Questions

1. How should the RAG agent integrate with existing conversation flows and agent interactions?
2. What is the preferred approach for handling large documents that exceed embedding context windows?
3. Should document clustering be performed real-time or batch processed?
4. What level of multi-modal processing is needed (OCR accuracy, table extraction complexity)?
5. How should document relationships be visualized and presented to users?
