# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an agentic conversation system where two AI agents engage in sequential dialogue, maintaining complete chat history within their context windows. The system will use LangChain or LangGraph to orchestrate the agent interactions, enabling dynamic conversations where each agent can build upon the previous responses while having access to the full conversation context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a system with two distinct AI agents that can converse with each other, so that I can observe emergent behaviors and collaborative problem-solving between agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create two distinct agent instances with different roles or personalities
2. WHEN an agent generates a response THEN the system SHALL pass that response to the other agent as input
3. WHEN each agent receives input THEN it SHALL have access to the complete conversation history up to that point
4. IF the conversation exceeds a predefined turn limit THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate the conversation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agents to maintain context throughout their conversation, so that they can reference previous statements and build coherent dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent generates a response THEN the system SHALL append it to the shared conversation history
2. WHEN an agent is prompted THEN it SHALL receive the full conversation history as context
3. WHEN the context window approaches its limit THEN the system SHALL implement a strategy to maintain relevant context (truncation, summarization, or sliding window)
4. WHEN the conversation starts THEN each agent SHALL be initialized with distinct system prompts defining their roles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use LangChain or LangGraph for orchestration, so that I can leverage established patterns for agent workflows and state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL use either LangChain or LangGraph as the primary orchestration framework
2. WHEN agents are created THEN they SHALL be implemented using the chosen framework's agent patterns
3. WHEN conversation flow is managed THEN it SHALL utilize the framework's state management capabilities
4. WHEN the system handles errors THEN it SHALL use the framework's error handling mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the conversation parameters through a single configuration file, so that I can easily manage all system settings in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL read configuration from a single file containing maximum conversation turns, model settings, and all prompts
2. WHEN the configuration file is loaded THEN it SHALL contain separate system prompts for each agent and an optional initial conversation prompt
3. WHEN the conversation runs THEN the configuration SHALL include language model parameters (model name, temperature, max tokens, etc.)
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate the configuration file and provide clear error messages for missing or invalid settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive telemetry and logging for each conversation run, so that I can analyze agent interactions, debug issues, and track system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation run starts THEN the system SHALL log all configuration settings including system prompts, agent prompts, and model parameters
2. WHEN agents exchange messages THEN the system SHALL log each message with timestamps, agent identifiers, token counts, and response times
3. WHEN the conversation completes THEN the system SHALL save a complete run log including telemetry data, conversation history, and performance metrics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the conversation state, stack traces, and recovery actions taken
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL optionally display the conversation in real-time to the console with telemetry information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it remains stable during unexpected scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent fails to generate a response THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a maximum number of attempts
2. WHEN the context window is exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement a fallback strategy to continue the conversation
3. WHEN an agent generates an empty or invalid response THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and continue or terminate appropriately
4. WHEN network or API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic and error reporting
