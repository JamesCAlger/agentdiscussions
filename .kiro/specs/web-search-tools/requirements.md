# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a modular tool system to the agentic conversation system, starting with web search capabilities. The system will allow agents to autonomously decide when to use tools based on their purpose and the conversation context. The architecture will be designed to support future tool additions while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular Tool System Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a flexible tool system that can support multiple types of tools, so that I can easily add new capabilities without modifying core agent logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load tool configurations from a centralized registry
2. WHEN a new tool is added THEN the system SHALL support it without requiring changes to existing agent implementations
3. WHEN tools are configured THEN each tool SHALL have its own configuration schema and validation
4. WHEN tools execute THEN they SHALL return standardized result objects that agents can process uniformly
5. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Agent-Driven Tool Selection

**User Story:** As an agent developer, I want agents to autonomously decide when to use tools based on their role and conversation context, so that tool usage is intelligent and purposeful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent generates a response THEN it SHALL evaluate whether any available tools are relevant to the current context
2. WHEN multiple tools are available THEN the agent SHALL select the most appropriate tool based on the conversation needs
3. WHEN a tool is not needed THEN the agent SHALL proceed with normal response generation without tool usage
4. WHEN tool results are obtained THEN the agent SHALL integrate them naturally into its response
5. WHEN tool usage would exceed context limits THEN the agent SHALL prioritize the most relevant information

### Requirement 3: Web Search Tool Implementation

**User Story:** As a conversation participant, I want agents to access current web information when discussing topics that benefit from real-time data, so that conversations include accurate and up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent determines web search is needed THEN it SHALL formulate appropriate search queries based on the conversation context
2. WHEN search results are retrieved THEN they SHALL be processed and summarized for relevance to the conversation
3. WHEN search results are integrated THEN they SHALL be clearly attributed and formatted appropriately
4. WHEN search APIs are unavailable THEN the agent SHALL gracefully continue without search capabilities
5. WHEN search results are irrelevant THEN the agent SHALL filter them out and may attempt alternative queries

### Requirement 4: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which tools are available to which agents through configuration files, so that I can control system capabilities without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agents THEN I SHALL be able to specify which tools each agent can access
2. WHEN configuring tools THEN I SHALL be able to set tool-specific parameters (API keys, rate limits, etc.)
3. WHEN adding new tool types THEN the configuration system SHALL support them through a plugin-like architecture
4. WHEN tools require authentication THEN the system SHALL securely manage API keys and credentials
5. WHEN tool configurations change THEN agents SHALL adapt without requiring system restart

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want tool usage to be efficient and not significantly impact conversation performance, so that the user experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools execute THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (configurable timeout)
2. WHEN multiple tools could be used THEN the system SHALL optimize for the most efficient combination
3. WHEN tool results are large THEN they SHALL be summarized to fit within context window constraints
4. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling and queuing
5. WHEN tools consume significant tokens THEN this SHALL be tracked and reported in telemetry

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a conversation participant, I want the system to handle tool failures gracefully without disrupting the conversation flow, so that discussions can continue even when external services are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool fails to execute THEN the agent SHALL continue with response generation using available information
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN agents SHALL fall back to their base capabilities without error
3. WHEN API quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests or disable tools temporarily
4. WHEN tool results are malformed THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize them before use
5. WHEN persistent tool failures occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate diagnostics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want tool usage to respect privacy and security best practices, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search queries are generated THEN they SHALL not include sensitive information from the conversation
2. WHEN API keys are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted and securely managed
3. WHEN tool results are cached THEN they SHALL respect appropriate retention policies
4. WHEN external APIs are called THEN requests SHALL be made over secure connections
5. WHEN user data is involved THEN it SHALL not be transmitted to external services without explicit consent

### Requirement 8: Observability and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and metrics for tool usage, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are invoked THEN the system SHALL log the decision-making process and parameters
2. WHEN tool execution completes THEN response times, success rates, and result quality SHALL be tracked
3. WHEN tools fail THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged for debugging
4. WHEN agents use tools THEN this SHALL be visible in conversation telemetry and exports
5. WHEN system performance is analyzed THEN tool usage metrics SHALL be available for optimization

### Requirement 9: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities for the tool system, so that I can ensure reliability and correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are developed THEN they SHALL include unit tests for all major functionality
2. WHEN the tool system is tested THEN it SHALL support mocking external APIs for reliable testing
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end tool usage scenarios
4. WHEN tool configurations are validated THEN the system SHALL catch configuration errors early
5. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN tool overhead SHALL be measurable and within acceptable limits

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Usability

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want clear documentation on how to create and integrate new tools, so that I can extend the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new tools THEN developers SHALL have clear interface specifications and examples
2. WHEN configuring tools THEN administrators SHALL have comprehensive configuration documentation
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be clearly presented
4. WHEN tools are used in conversations THEN their impact SHALL be transparent to users
5. WHEN the system evolves THEN documentation SHALL be maintained and updated accordingly
